Text Completion and Auto-Correction Tool
Welcome to the Text Completion and Auto-Correction Tool! This project is designed to assist users in modifying and correcting text files efficiently. Whether it's completing words, converting numbers, or fixing punctuation, this tool has got you covered.

Objectives
In this project, we leverage functions from a previous repository to create a simple yet powerful text editing tool. Here are the primary objectives:

Utilize existing functions written in Go
Develop a text completion, editing, and auto-correction system
Implement features such as converting hex and binary numbers, adjusting letter case, and fixing punctuation
Ensure the codebase adheres to good practices and is easily testable
Introduction
This project is built using Go, a powerful and efficient programming language. We emphasize clean coding practices and encourage the inclusion of test files for unit testing.

The tool provides various functionalities, including:

Conversion of hexadecimal and binary numbers
Adjustment of letter case (uppercase, lowercase, capitalized)
Fixing punctuation placement and formatting
Usage
To use the tool, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Execute the tool with appropriate arguments:
sh
Copy code
go run . input_file.txt output_file.txt
View the modified text in the output file.
Examples
Here are some examples demonstrating the tool's capabilities:

Converting hex and binary numbers:
sh
Copy code
$ cat input.txt
Simply add 42 (hex) and 10 (bin) and you will see the result is 68.
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
Simply add 66 and 2 and you will see the result is 68.
Adjusting letter case:
sh
Copy code
$ cat input.txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times (up) , it was the age of wisdom...
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of TIMES, it was the age of wisdom...
Fixing punctuation:
sh
Copy code
$ cat input.txt
Punctuation tests are ... kinda boring ,don't you think !?
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
Punctuation tests are... kinda boring, don't you think!?
Conclusion
With this tool, you can efficiently edit and correct text files according to your needs. Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute improvements, or report any issues you encounter.

Happy editing!
