# Text Completion and Auto-Correction Tool

Welcome to the **Text Completion and Auto-Correction Tool**! This project is designed to help users modify and correct text files efficiently. Whether it's completing words, converting numbers, or fixing punctuation, this tool has all the features you need for precise text editing.

## Objectives

This project builds on functions from a previous repository to create a versatile text editing tool. The key objectives include:

- **Leverage existing Go functions** for text manipulation
- **Develop a system for text completion, editing, and auto-correction**
- **Implement features** like converting hex and binary numbers, adjusting letter cases, and correcting punctuation
- **Maintain clean, testable code** that adheres to best practices

## Introduction

Built with Go, this project emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and clean coding practices. Unit testing is encouraged to ensure functionality and reliability.

### Key Features:
- **Hexadecimal and binary conversion** (e.g., converting `42 (hex)` or `10 (bin)` into decimal values)
- **Letter case adjustments** (uppercase, lowercase, title case)
- **Punctuation corrections** (fixing misplaced commas, ellipses, and more)

## Usage

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. Run the tool with the appropriate arguments:
   ```bash
   go run . input_file.txt output_file.txt
   ```

4. The modified text will be saved to the specified output file.

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the tool's features:

### 1. Converting Hex and Binary Numbers:
```bash
$ cat input.txt
Simply add 42 (hex) and 10 (bin) and you will see the result is 68.
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
Simply add 66 and 2 and you will see the result is 68.
```

### 2. Adjusting Letter Case:
```bash
$ cat input.txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times (up) , it was the age of wisdom...
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of TIMES, it was the age of wisdom...
```

### 3. Fixing Punctuation:
```bash
$ cat input.txt
Punctuation tests are ... kinda boring ,don't you think !?
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
$ cat output.txt
Punctuation tests are... kinda boring, don't you think!?
```
